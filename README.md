# Materials related to my data analytics thesis work on Chinese Peonies

PHOTOGRAPHIC folder contains all photographic documentation taken on the LUKE test field.
Photos are under subfolders named for every peony sample's location identifier.

Instead of viewing photos in browser or saving them one by one, you can download the photos from a chosen directory by pasting the link of that directory in https://download-directory.github.io/

Here is a download link for the whole photographic directory (zip size ~ 240 MB):

PLOTS folder contains all the general and sample group specific plotted images present in the document.
Also collage photos of sample groups are found here.

CODE and MEASUREMENT DATA folder contains a Jupyter Notebook file containing all the Python code used for data handling and visualization in this work.
Files for original and cleaned up measurement data are also located here. Original genetic data from the samples is not shared publically, but instructions on applying genetic marker data are found alongside the code in analysis.ipynb .
